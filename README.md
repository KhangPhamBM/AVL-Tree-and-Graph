# AVL Tree and Graph

## Description
The Java Console application includes basic implementations such as addition, removal, searching, and traversal, along with different algorithms related to finding the shortest path and smallest spanning tree. The app includes 2 parts: AVL tree and Graph.

## About

## AVL Tree
The AVL Tree implementation includes the following functionalities:

- Insertion: Allows you to insert new nodes into the AVL tree.
- Deletion: Supports the removal of nodes from the AVL tree.
- Searching: Enables searching for a specific value within the AVL tree.
- Traversal: Supports various traversal methods to visit all nodes in the tree.
- Load/Update: Allows loading and updating TreeNode data from a text file.
The AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, ensuring that the height difference between left and right subtrees of any node is at most one. This property guarantees efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Graph
The Graph implementation includes the following functionalities:

- Insertion: Allows you to add vertices and edges to the graph.
- Deletion: Supports the removal of vertices and edges from the graph.
- Updating: Enables updating the values of vertices and edges in the graph.
- Traversal: Supports various traversal methods to visit all vertices and edges in the graph.
- Load/Update: Allows loading and updating graph data from a file.
Additionally, the Graph part provides several algorithms as:

- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path between two vertices in the graph.
- Floyd's Algorithm: Determines the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in the graph.
- Euler's Algorithm: Finds an Eulerian path or circuit in the graph.

## Usage
To use the AVL Tree and Graph application, follow these steps:
1. Compile and run the Java application using a Java development environment or command line tools.
2. Choose whether to work with the AVL Tree or Graph functionality.
 - For AVL Tree:
   + Use the available commands to perform insertions, deletions, searches, traversals, and loading/updating of tree nodes.
   + Follow the prompts to provide the necessary input values for each operation.
 - For Graph:
   + Use the available commands to perform insertions, deletions, updates, traversals, and loading/updating of the graph.
   + Follow the prompts to provide the necessary input values for each operation.
   + When using Dijkstra's, Floyd's, or Euler's algorithm, specify the required vertices or edges to compute the desired result.
